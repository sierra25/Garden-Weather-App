# Garden-Weather-App
Built a garden weather app that, given the user input of location, tells the user the temperature outside
and whether the temperature is within the range that a specific crop can handle.

Displayed a list of common garden crops and the temperature ranges that they can handle alongside a
dynamically rendered green checkmark or red x mark.

Created dynamic messages telling users whether a certain plant is happy based on the current weather
temperature for the userâ€™s area
